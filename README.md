# fetch-backend-api
A RESTful API for managing user points by tracking transactions from multiple payers. Users can add points, spend points following an "oldest-first" policy, and check their current balance by payer. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js, with a min-heap (priority queue) to ensure efficient point spending.
